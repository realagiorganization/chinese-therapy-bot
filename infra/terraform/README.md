# MindWell Terraform Infrastructure

This configuration captures the **Phase 2 â€“ Platform & Infrastructure Setup** scope outlined in `PROGRESS.md` and `DEV_PLAN.md`. It codifies the baseline Azure and AWS resources required to stand up the MindWell platform.

## Whatâ€™s Included

- Azure resource group, virtual network, and subnets with delegated networking for PostgreSQL.
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with workload identity, Log Analytics integration, and user node pool autoscaling.
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server (zone redundant) and secret bootstrap via Key Vault.
- Azure Application Insights (workspace-based) plus Azure Portal dashboard and workbook-friendly metrics for runtime observability.
- Azure Key Vault with RBAC, soft-delete, and secret seeding for the database administrator password.
- AWS S3 buckets for conversation logs, summaries, and therapist media with encryption, versioning, and IAM role for the CI Runner Agent.
- AWS Secrets Manager placeholders for model credentials and agent integrations.
- Azure Monitor action group, AKS CPU alert, application error-rate scheduled query alert, and Azure cost budget notifications for spend visibility.

## Usage

1. Copy `backend.hcl.example` to `backend.hcl` and populate the Azure Storage account details that will hold the state file. The Terraform service principal must have at least **Storage Blob Data Contributor** access to the storage account.
2. Create a `terraform.tfvars` (or environment-specific `*.tfvars`) file with required values:

```hcl
environment                  = "dev"
azure_subscription_id        = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
azure_tenant_id              = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
aws_account_id               = "222222222222"
s3_logs_bucket_name          = "mindwell-dev-conversation-logs"
s3_summaries_bucket_name     = "mindwell-dev-summaries"
s3_media_bucket_name         = "mindwell-dev-media"
application_insights_name    = "appi-mindwell-dev"
monthly_cost_budget_amount   = 200
cost_budget_start_date       = "2025-01-01"
cost_budget_end_date         = "2025-12-31"
cost_budget_contact_emails   = ["finance@mindwell.dev", "platform@mindwell.dev"]
key_vault_admin_object_ids   = ["33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333"]
oidc_github_workload_client_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

3. Initialize and plan the deployment:

```bash
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Remote State:** Alternatively, pass `-backend-config` flags directly in CI/CD if injecting secrets through environment variables.

## Notes & Next Steps

- Subnet CIDRs and resource names are parameterized to support future staging/prod environments.
- Additional node pools (GPU/inference) and workbook visualizations can be layered as Phase 2 progresses.
- Secrets Manager secrets are placeholders; populate key/value pairs via CI/CD once the real credentials exist.
- Firewall/IP allowlists should be refined once corporate network ranges are finalized.
- S3 lifecycle policies now:
  - Transition conversation transcripts in `conversations/` to Standard-IA after 30 days, Glacier after 90 days, and purge after 1 year.
  - Transition daily/weekly summaries in `summaries/` to Standard-IA after 60 days, Glacier after 180 days, with a 2 year retention window.
  - Expire media uploads after 365 days and automatically clean up incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days.
