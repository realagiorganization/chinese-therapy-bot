# PROGRESS.md Verification Notes

These notes capture evidence that the completed checklist items in `PROGRESS.md` correspond to artifacts in the repository.

## Phase 0 – Foundations
- Architecture, cloud target, and CI/CD workflows are codified in `docs/phase0_foundations.md:5-62`, matching the completed foundational tasks.

## Phase 1 – Core Product Design
- User journeys, chatbot–therapist integration logic, retention policy, and wireframe guidance are detailed in `docs/phase1_product_design.md:5-131`, aligning with Phase 1 checkmarks.

## Phase 2 – Platform & Infrastructure
- Azure AKS cluster provisioning with workload identity and networking is defined in `infra/terraform/azure_aks.tf:1-79`.
- Remote Terraform state backend is configured via `infra/terraform/backend.hcl.example:1-27`.
- Key Vault secrets management and CSI integration are implemented in `infra/terraform/azure_keyvault.tf:1-52` and described in `docs/phase2_secret_management.md:1-57`.
- Observability stack and cost guardrails are modeled in `infra/terraform/observability.tf:1-150`.
- GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/infra-plan.yml` and helper script `infra/scripts/run_terraform_plan.sh` generate repeatable Terraform plans, while `infra/scripts/bootstrap_kubeconfig.sh` documents kubeconfig retrieval.
- Workload identity validation manifest resides at `infra/kubernetes/samples/workload-identity-validation.yaml`, enabling the pending checklist item to be executed once AKS is live.

## Phase 3 – Backend Services
- FastAPI services, router wiring, and modular architecture live under `services/backend/app/api/router.py:1-120`.
- Chat orchestration with streaming, transcript persistence, and memory capture is implemented in `services/backend/app/services/chat.py:1-200`.
- S3 transcript and summary storage integrations reside in `services/backend/app/integrations/storage.py:1-179`.
- Therapist recommendation engine with embeddings and heuristics is in `services/backend/app/services/recommendations.py:1-180`.
- Conversation memory service with keyword filtering and summarization is defined in `services/backend/app/services/memory.py:1-200`.
- Google OAuth stub, OTP throttling, and token rotation support are codified across `services/backend/app/services/auth.py:1-220` and `app/api/routes/auth.py:1-160`, aligning with the Phase 3 identity management checklist.

## Phase 4 – Frontend Experience
- React web client with localization, journey reports, and therapist flows has supporting tests in `clients/web/src/App.test.tsx:1-131`.
- Streaming chat UI with Web Speech input, server ASR fallback, and speech synthesis toggles is implemented in `clients/web/src/components/ChatPanel.tsx:1-280` and `clients/web/src/hooks/useChatSession.ts:1-260`, satisfying the voice interaction deliverables.
- Therapist directory filtering, recommendations, and design-system adoption are provided in `clients/web/src/components/TherapistDirectory.tsx:1-220` and `clients/web/src/hooks/useTherapistDirectory.ts:1-200`.

## Mobile Client Scaffold
- Expo-based React Native application lives under `clients/mobile/`, with app entry in `clients/mobile/App.tsx:1-54` wiring shared theming and auth context.
- SMS + Google login flows are implemented in `clients/mobile/src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx:1-189` backed by context logic in `clients/mobile/src/context/AuthContext.tsx:1-238`.
- Chat shell consuming the FastAPI backend exists at `clients/mobile/src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx:1-260`, delegating API interaction to `clients/mobile/src/services/chat.ts:1-72`.

## Phase 5 – Intelligent Agent Features
- Summary scheduler agent implementation exists at `services/backend/app/agents/summary_scheduler.py:1-120`.
- Summary generation pipeline with daily and weekly workflows is covered by `services/backend/app/services/summaries.py:1-200`.

## Cost & Resource Planning
- Infrastructure, LLM, and tooling budgets with alert guardrails are documented in `docs/cost_controls.md:1-176`, supporting the completed checklist items.

## Phase 6 – Quality Assurance
- Backend unit tests for chat streaming and transcript persistence reside in `services/backend/tests/test_chat_service.py:1-165`, demonstrating coverage of the documented behaviors.
- Summary generation pipeline coverage added via `services/backend/tests/test_summaries.py:1-200`, validating daily summary persistence, heuristic fallback, and mood scoring logic.
- Load testing scaffolding is present in `services/backend/loadtests/locustfile.py:1-160`.
- Encryption enforcement across Azure/AWS resources documented in `docs/security/encryption_validation.md:1-74`, covering TLS requirements and server-side encryption updates.
- Data retention automation implemented via `services/backend/app/agents/retention_cleanup.py:1-260` with coverage in `tests/test_retention_cleanup_agent.py:1-150`, matching the compliance automation checklist.

## Phase 7 – Deployment & Operations
- Terraform apply automation with manual approval gates is codified in `.github/workflows/infra-apply.yml:1-213`, leveraging the new helper script `infra/scripts/run_terraform_apply.sh:1-170` to reuse signed plan artifacts.
- Customer support and incident response workflows are documented in `docs/operations/incident_response.md:1-123`, aligning with the requirement to establish escalation playbooks.

## Outstanding Areas
- Tasks still unchecked in `PROGRESS.md` (e.g., Terraform apply execution, security review actions, data governance runbooks) remain pending and are not evidenced in the repository.
