# PROGRESS.md Verification Notes

These notes capture evidence that the completed checklist items in `PROGRESS.md` correspond to artifacts in the repository.

## Phase 0 – Foundations
- Architecture, cloud target, and CI/CD workflows are codified in `docs/phase0_foundations.md:5-62`, matching the completed foundational tasks.

## Phase 1 – Core Product Design
- User journeys, chatbot–therapist integration logic, retention policy, and wireframe guidance are detailed in `docs/phase1_product_design.md:5-131`, aligning with Phase 1 checkmarks.

## Phase 2 – Platform & Infrastructure
- Azure AKS cluster provisioning with workload identity and networking is defined in `infra/terraform/azure_aks.tf:1-79`.
- Remote Terraform state backend is configured via `infra/terraform/backend.hcl.example:1-27`.
- Key Vault secrets management and CSI integration are implemented in `infra/terraform/azure_keyvault.tf:1-52` and described in `docs/phase2_secret_management.md:1-57`.
- Observability stack and cost guardrails are modeled in `infra/terraform/observability.tf:1-150`.

## Phase 3 – Backend Services
- FastAPI services, router wiring, and modular architecture live under `services/backend/app/api/router.py:1-120`.
- Chat orchestration with streaming, transcript persistence, and memory capture is implemented in `services/backend/app/services/chat.py:1-200`.
- S3 transcript and summary storage integrations reside in `services/backend/app/integrations/storage.py:1-179`.
- Therapist recommendation engine with embeddings and heuristics is in `services/backend/app/services/recommendations.py:1-180`.
- Conversation memory service with keyword filtering and summarization is defined in `services/backend/app/services/memory.py:1-200`.

## Phase 4 – Frontend Experience
- React web client with localization, journey reports, and therapist flows has supporting tests in `clients/web/src/App.test.tsx:1-131`.

## Phase 5 – Intelligent Agent Features
- Summary scheduler agent implementation exists at `services/backend/app/agents/summary_scheduler.py:1-120`.
- Summary generation pipeline with daily and weekly workflows is covered by `services/backend/app/services/summaries.py:1-200`.

## Phase 6 – Quality Assurance
- Backend unit tests for chat streaming and transcript persistence reside in `services/backend/tests/test_chat_service.py:1-165`, demonstrating coverage of the documented behaviors.
- Load testing scaffolding is present in `services/backend/loadtests/locustfile.py:1-160`.

## Outstanding Areas
- Tasks still unchecked in `PROGRESS.md` (e.g., Terraform apply execution, security review actions, data governance runbooks) remain pending and are not evidenced in the repository.
