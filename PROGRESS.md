# MindWell Implementation Progress

## Phase 0 – Foundations
- [x] Review DEV_PLAN.md and existing documentation to align on scope and priorities.
- [x] Define target architecture diagram covering frontend, backend, data, and AI services.
- [x] Select primary cloud deployment target (default Azure AKS) and document rationale.
- [x] Establish project repositories, branching strategy, and CI/CD workflow (GitHub Actions on EC2 runners).

## Phase 1 – Core Product Design
- [x] Document detailed user journeys for chatbot therapy sessions, therapist browsing, and progress tracking. *(see `docs/phase1_product_design.md`)*
- [x] Specify therapist–chatbot integration logic, including recommendation triggers and data flow. *(see `docs/phase1_product_design.md`)*
- [x] Finalize conversation history schema and retention policy (real-time logs, daily snapshots, weekly summaries). *(see `docs/phase1_product_design.md`)*
- [x] Define UX wireframes for chatbot, therapist showcase, Journey reports, and Explore page. *(see `docs/phase1_product_design.md`)*

## Phase 2 – Platform & Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Provision Azure AKS cluster, configure node pools, and set up cluster networking. *(Terraform definitions prepared; apply pending.)*
- [ ] Configure AWS S3 buckets for conversation logs, summaries, and media assets with appropriate IAM roles. *(Buckets + IAM role codified in Terraform.)*
- [ ] Set up managed database (Azure Postgres or AWS RDS) with schemas for users, therapists, sessions, and reports. *(Azure Flexible Server defined with private networking; migrations pending.)*
- [ ] Implement secret management (Azure Key Vault + AWS Secrets Manager) and IaC templates (Terraform/Bicep). *(Key Vault + Secrets Manager configuration authored.)*
- [ ] Configure observability stack (logging, metrics, alerts) and cost monitoring dashboards. *(Log Analytics, dashboard, and alert wiring added via Terraform.)*

## Phase 3 – Backend Services
- [x] Scaffold backend service (FastAPI) with modular architecture. *(see `docs/phase3_backend_scaffold.md` & `services/backend/`)*
- [x] Define SQLAlchemy persistence layer covering users, therapists, chat sessions/messages, and summary tables.
- [x] Integrate async database access for chat, therapist directory, and reports services with graceful seed fallbacks.
- [ ] Implement authentication service supporting SMS, Google OAuth, and token renewal endpoints.
- [ ] Build chat service for message ingestion, streaming responses, and persistence to database/S3. *(database persistence complete; streaming + S3 storage pending.)*
- [ ] Integrate AI model orchestrator (Azure OpenAI primary, AWS Bedrock fallback) with prompt templates.
- [ ] Implement therapist data management APIs (list/get, filtering, admin imports, i18n support).
- [ ] Develop summary generation pipeline (daily & weekly) with scheduled workers and storage integration.
- [ ] Expose journey report APIs delivering recent summaries and chat history slices.
- [ ] Add feature flags/configuration service to toggle experimental capabilities.

## Phase 4 – Frontend & Mobile Clients
- [ ] Set up shared design system and localization framework (Chinese-first).
- [ ] Implement chatbot screen with streaming UI, voice input (local + server ASR), and TTS playback controls.
- [ ] Build therapist overview/detail pages with filters and recommendation badges.
- [ ] Create Journey page showing 10-day daily reports and 10-week weekly reports with drill-down tabs.
- [ ] Prototype Explore page content modules and personalization hooks.
- [ ] Implement account onboarding/login flows (SMS, Google).
- [ ] Ensure iOS optimization (gesture handling, offline caching, push notifications).
- [ ] Ensure Android optimization (voice integration parity, performance, compatibility).

## Phase 5 – Intelligent Agent Features
- [ ] Implement conversation memory service with keyword filtering and summarization store.
- [ ] Build therapist recommendation engine leveraging embeddings + prompt standardization.
- [ ] Add RAG pipeline for contextual response generation with conversation snippets and therapist knowledge base.
- [ ] Develop tooling to evaluate model response quality and guardrails.

## Phase 6 – Quality Assurance & Compliance
- [ ] Create automated testing suites (unit, integration, end-to-end) and load testing scenarios.
- [ ] Conduct security review (OWASP ASVS, data encryption, privacy compliance).
- [ ] Implement data governance workflows for PII management and retention.
- [ ] Run user acceptance testing with pilot users and collect feedback for iteration.

## Phase 7 – Deployment & Operations
- [ ] Finalize CI/CD pipelines for backend, frontend, and mobile releases.
- [ ] Prepare release management process for App Store/TestFlight and Android beta.
- [ ] Establish customer support workflows and incident response playbooks.
- [ ] Monitor production metrics post-launch and iterate based on telemetry.

## Phase 8 – Documentation & Launch Readiness
- [ ] Complete ENVS.md with environment variable definitions and secure handling notes.
- [ ] Update README.md with setup instructions, architecture overview, and usage guide.
- [ ] Prepare investor/partner summary collateral (optional DOCX/PDF).
- [ ] Maintain DEV_PLAN and PROGRESS updates as milestones are achieved.
