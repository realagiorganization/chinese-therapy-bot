# MindWell Implementation Progress

## Phase 0 – Foundations
- [x] Review DEV_PLAN.md and existing documentation to align on scope and priorities.
- [x] Define target architecture diagram covering frontend, backend, data, and AI services.
- [x] Select primary cloud deployment target (default Azure AKS) and document rationale.
- [x] Establish project repositories, branching strategy, and CI/CD workflow (GitHub Actions on EC2 runners). *(CI pipeline codified in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running backend tests & linting.)*

## Phase 1 – Core Product Design
- [x] Document detailed user journeys for chatbot therapy sessions, therapist browsing, and progress tracking. *(see `docs/phase1_product_design.md`)*
- [x] Specify therapist–chatbot integration logic, including recommendation triggers and data flow. *(see `docs/phase1_product_design.md`)*
- [x] Finalize conversation history schema and retention policy (real-time logs, daily snapshots, weekly summaries). *(see `docs/phase1_product_design.md`)*
- [x] Define UX wireframes for chatbot, therapist showcase, Journey reports, and Explore page. *(see `docs/phase1_product_design.md`)*

## Phase 2 – Platform & Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Provision Azure AKS cluster, configure node pools, and set up cluster networking. *(Terraform definitions in `infra/terraform/azure_*.tf`; apply pending.)*
- [ ] Configure AWS S3 buckets for conversation logs, summaries, and media assets with appropriate IAM roles. *(Buckets + IAM role codified in `infra/terraform/aws_storage.tf`.)*
- [x] Set up managed database (Azure Postgres or AWS RDS) with schemas for users, therapists, sessions, and reports. *(Azure Flexible Server defined with private networking in `infra/terraform/azure_postgres.tf`; Alembic migrations under `services/backend/alembic/` bootstrap the schema.)*
- [ ] Implement secret management (Azure Key Vault + AWS Secrets Manager) and IaC templates (Terraform/Bicep). *(Key Vault and Secrets Manager placeholders authored in `infra/terraform/azure_keyvault.tf` & `secrets.tf`.)*
- [x] Configure observability stack (logging, metrics, alerts) and cost monitoring dashboards. *(App Insights, AKS CPU + error alerts, Azure Portal dashboard, and cost budget alerts codified in `infra/terraform/observability.tf`.)*

## Phase 3 – Backend Services
- [x] Scaffold backend service (FastAPI) with modular architecture. *(see `docs/phase3_backend_scaffold.md` & `services/backend/`)*
- [x] Define SQLAlchemy persistence layer covering users, therapists, chat sessions/messages, and summary tables.
- [x] Integrate async database access for chat, therapist directory, and reports services with graceful seed fallbacks.
- [x] Implement SMS OTP challenge persistence with expiration, throttling, and SMS provider abstraction.
- [x] Implement token issuance with JWT access/refresh tokens, rotation, and token renewal endpoint.
- [x] Integrate Google OAuth code verification stub and user identity linking.
- [x] Build chat service for message ingestion, streaming responses, and persistence to database/S3. *(FastAPI endpoint now supports SSE streaming with transcript archival.)*
- [x] Integrate AI model orchestrator (Azure OpenAI primary, AWS Bedrock fallback) with prompt templates.
- [x] Persist chat transcripts and metadata to AWS S3 conversation logs bucket.
- [x] Implement therapist data management APIs (list/get, filtering, admin imports, i18n support). *(FastAPI service now supports locale-aware responses and S3-backed imports via `/api/therapists/admin/import`.)*
- [x] Develop summary generation pipeline (daily & weekly) with scheduled workers and storage integration. *(see `services/backend/app/services/summaries.py` & `app/agents/summary_scheduler.py`)*
- [x] Expose journey report APIs delivering recent summaries and chat history slices. *(Journey endpoint returns daily/weekly digests plus recent conversation slices via `ReportsService`.)*
- [x] Add feature flags/configuration service to toggle experimental capabilities. *(FeatureFlagService with `/api/features` router enables runtime toggles + percentage rollouts backed by Postgres.)*

## Phase 4 – Frontend & Mobile Clients
- [ ] Set up shared design system and localization framework (Chinese-first).
- [ ] Implement chatbot screen with streaming UI, voice input (local + server ASR), and TTS playback controls.
- [ ] Build therapist overview/detail pages with filters and recommendation badges.
- [ ] Create Journey page showing 10-day daily reports and 10-week weekly reports with drill-down tabs.
- [ ] Prototype Explore page content modules and personalization hooks.
- [ ] Implement account onboarding/login flows (SMS, Google).
- [ ] Ensure iOS optimization (gesture handling, offline caching, push notifications).
- [ ] Ensure Android optimization (voice integration parity, performance, compatibility).

## Phase 5 – Intelligent Agent Features
- [x] Implement conversation memory service with keyword filtering and summarization store. *(see `services/backend/app/services/memory.py` & `/api/memory/{userId}`)*
- [x] Build therapist recommendation engine leveraging embeddings + prompt standardization. *(see `services/backend/app/services/recommendations.py` using Azure/OpenAI embeddings with heuristic fallback + `ChatService` integration)*
- [x] Add RAG pipeline for contextual response generation with conversation snippets and therapist knowledge base. *(chat context prompt now stitches therapist recommendations + memory highlights in `services/backend/app/services/chat.py`)*
- [x] Develop tooling to evaluate model response quality and guardrails. *(Guardrail heuristics + evaluation API via `services/backend/app/services/evaluation.py` and `/api/evaluations/response`.)*

## Phase 6 – Quality Assurance & Compliance
- [ ] Create automated testing suites (unit, integration, end-to-end) and load testing scenarios.
- [ ] Conduct security review (OWASP ASVS, data encryption, privacy compliance).
- [ ] Implement data governance workflows for PII management and retention.
- [ ] Run user acceptance testing with pilot users and collect feedback for iteration.

## Phase 7 – Deployment & Operations
- [ ] Finalize CI/CD pipelines for backend, frontend, and mobile releases.
- [ ] Prepare release management process for App Store/TestFlight and Android beta.
- [ ] Establish customer support workflows and incident response playbooks.
- [ ] Monitor production metrics post-launch and iterate based on telemetry.

## Phase 8 – Documentation & Launch Readiness
- [ ] Complete ENVS.md with environment variable definitions and secure handling notes.
- [ ] Update README.md with setup instructions, architecture overview, and usage guide.
- [ ] Prepare investor/partner summary collateral (optional DOCX/PDF).
- [ ] Maintain DEV_PLAN and PROGRESS updates as milestones are achieved.
