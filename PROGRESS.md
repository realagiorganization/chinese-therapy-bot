# MindWell Implementation Progress

### Verification Snapshot
- Confirmed referenced Phase 0/1 design artifacts exist under `docs/` (e.g., `docs/phase0_foundations.md`, `docs/phase1_product_design.md`) and align with completed checkboxes.
- Validated Terraform modules for remote state, AKS, observability, and secret management under `infra/terraform/`, matching Phase 2 completed tasks.
- Spot-checked backend services (chat, summaries, feature flags) to ensure the implementations cited in Phase 3 are present and wired into FastAPI dependencies.

## Phase 0 – Foundations
- [x] Review DEV_PLAN.md and existing documentation to align on scope and priorities.
- [x] Define target architecture diagram covering frontend, backend, data, and AI services.
- [x] Select primary cloud deployment target (default Azure AKS) and document rationale.
- [x] Establish project repositories, branching strategy, and CI/CD workflow (GitHub Actions on EC2 runners). *(CI pipeline codified in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running backend tests & linting.)*

## Phase 1 – Core Product Design
- [x] Document detailed user journeys for chatbot therapy sessions, therapist browsing, and progress tracking. *(see `docs/phase1_product_design.md`)*
- [x] Specify therapist–chatbot integration logic, including recommendation triggers and data flow. *(see `docs/phase1_product_design.md`)*
- [x] Finalize conversation history schema and retention policy (real-time logs, daily snapshots, weekly summaries). *(see `docs/phase1_product_design.md`)*
- [x] Define UX wireframes for chatbot, therapist showcase, Journey reports, and Explore page. *(see `docs/phase1_product_design.md`)*

## Phase 2 – Platform & Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Provision Azure AKS cluster, configure node pools, and set up cluster networking. *(Terraform definitions in `infra/terraform/azure_*.tf`; apply pending.)*
  - [x] Configure remote Terraform state (Azure Storage/Key Vault) and document backend credentials.
  - [ ] Run `terraform plan`/`apply` for the dev subscription and capture kubeconfig bootstrap steps for CI runners.
  - [ ] Validate workload identity/OIDC by deploying a sample pod that fetches a Key Vault secret.
- [ ] Configure AWS S3 buckets for conversation logs, summaries, and media assets with appropriate IAM roles. *(Buckets + IAM role codified in `infra/terraform/aws_storage.tf`.)*
  - [ ] Execute Terraform against the target AWS account and capture bucket ARNs plus IAM outputs.
  - [ ] Script CI Runner Agent role assumption (federated login) and document temporary credential retrieval.
  - [x] Define lifecycle rules/prefix conventions for transcripts, summaries, and therapist media ingestion.
- [x] Set up managed database (Azure Postgres or AWS RDS) with schemas for users, therapists, sessions, and reports. *(Azure Flexible Server defined with private networking in `infra/terraform/azure_postgres.tf`; Alembic migrations under `services/backend/alembic/` bootstrap the schema.)*
- [x] Implement secret management (Azure Key Vault + AWS Secrets Manager) and IaC templates (Terraform/Bicep). *(Terraform seeds connection secrets/role assignments in `infra/terraform/azure_keyvault.tf`, rotation SOP in `docs/phase2_secret_management.md`, and backend manifests under `infra/kubernetes/backend/` mount secrets via CSI driver.)*
