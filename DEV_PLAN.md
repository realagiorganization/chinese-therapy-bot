---

## **4. Development Log**

**Status:** Up to date as of 2025-11-03 — mirror entries with `PROGRESS.md` for granular milestone tracking (latest backend regression run: `pytest`, 70 passed at 13:21 UTC).

### **Infrastructure & Platform**

- Terraform baseline revalidated locally on 2025-11-03 with Terraform 1.6.6 (`terraform init -backend=false`, `terraform validate`). Execution of `run_terraform_plan.sh` / `run_terraform_apply.sh` stays blocked pending Azure service principal + AWS role credentials; once supplied, apply outputs (AKS kubeconfig, S3 bucket ARNs, IAM role ARN) will be captured for CI runners.

### **Business Logic & Backend**

#### **Account Management**

- Username/password login ✅ *(deprecated before launch)*
- SMS login ✅ *(OTP challenge + verification shipped in `services/backend/app/services/auth.py` with mobile/web flows.)*
- Third-party account integration (Google, etc.) ✅ *(Google OAuth stub client + token exchange live across backend/web/mobile.)*
- Token renewal ✅

#### **Chat System**

- Persistent conversation storage
  - Real-time chat logging ✅ *(message-level S3 persistence via ChatTranscriptStorage)*
  - Daily chat snapshot storage ✅ *(persisted to S3 via ChatTranscriptStorage)*
- Summary generation
  - Daily summaries ✅ *(pipeline implemented via Summary Scheduler Agent)*
  - Weekly summaries ✅ *(weekly aggregation + storage complete)*
- Guided chat templates for common scenes ✅ *(curated dataset `chat_templates.json`, `/api/chat/templates`, and web quick-start chips).*

#### **Model Integration**

- Static model response ✅ *(deprecated before launch)*
- Debug-stage raw model integration ✅ *(Azure-first orchestrator with AWS Bedrock fallback now covered by `tests/test_llm_orchestrator.py`.)*
- Intelligent agent integration ✅ *(Conversation memory, recommendations, and evaluation guardrails wired into chat orchestration.)*

#### **Pilot Feedback**

- Structured intake ✅ *(`PilotFeedback` persistence + `/api/feedback/pilot` endpoints with regression tests `test_feedback_service.py` / `test_feedback_api.py` capture cohort sentiment and blockers.)*
- Feedback aggregation CLI ✅ *(`mindwell-pilot-feedback-report` summarizes sentiment/trust/usability scores and top tags to inform backlog triage.)*

#### **Pilot Cohort Recruitment**

- Participant roster management ✅ *(New `PilotCohortParticipant` model, service `/api/pilot-cohort`, and CLI `mindwell-pilot-cohort` track invites/onboarding with regression coverage in `test_pilot_cohort_service.py` / `test_pilot_cohort_api.py`.)*
- Cohort engagement automation 🔄 *(Follow-up messaging templates + CRM sync pending pilot launch.)*

#### **Therapist Data**

- list/get API ✅
- Script for scraping therapist data and injecting into database ✅ *(Data Sync agent `mindwell-data-sync` publishes normalized profiles to `S3_BUCKET_THERAPISTS`.)*
- Internationalization (i18n) of therapist information ✅

#### **Data Governance & Privacy**

- Retention automation ✅ *(Summary Scheduler + `mindwell-retention-cleanup` enforce S3/database purge windows.)*
- Subject access/export tooling ✅ *(SAR scripts in `services/backend/scripts/` backed by `DataSubjectService` and tests.)*
- PII deletion/redaction flow ✅ *(`delete_user_data.py` scrubs chat content, revokes tokens, and anonymises analytics/summary artefacts.)*

#### **AWS Integration**

- RDS ✅ *(Terraform modules `infra/terraform/aws_network.tf` + `aws_rds.tf` provision an optional PostgreSQL replica with Secrets Manager credentials seeding.)*
- EC2 instances ✅ *(Automation agent host defined in `infra/terraform/aws_ec2_agents.tf` runs Data Sync/Summary Scheduler workloads with controlled SSH ingress.)*

Would you like me to also convert this into a **formatted technical document template (e.g., Markdown → PDF or DOCX)** with consistent section numbering, table of contents, and company footer branding (e.g., “MindWell Confidential – 2025”)? That would make it suitable for investor decks or engineering sprints.
